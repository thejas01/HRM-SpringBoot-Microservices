# HRM-SpringBoot-Microservices
Building a modular Employee Management System (EMS) using microservices architecture. The system includes authentication with JWT, employee data management via REST APIs, performance profiling with Spring Boot Actuator, logging via AOP, and communication through Feign Client. Utilize Eureka for service discovery and API Gateway for routing.

Features and Modules:

1. Authentication and Authorization (Spring Security + JWT)
      -Implement JWT-based authentication for securing REST APIs.
      -Allow user login with username/password, and return a JWT token upon successful login.
      -Integrate Spring Security to protect endpoints based on roles (e.g., Admin, User).
      -Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for various user roles in the system.
2. Employee Service (REST API)
Create a microservice responsible for managing employee data (CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Use RESTful API for interacting with the employee data (e.g., /employees, /employee/{id}).
Implement DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for communication between the client and the service.
4. Authentication Service (Microservice)
This microservice will be responsible for user authentication (login, token validation).
Implement a login API that validates credentials and generates JWT tokens.
Integrate this service with the Employee Service to secure access to employee data.
5. Profiling (Performance Monitoring)
Use Spring Boot Actuator to profile and monitor the performance of the application.
Integrate custom profiling for each microservice (e.g., measuring the time taken for specific API calls).
Add a health check endpoint (/actuator/health) to monitor the overall system health.
6. Logging and Monitoring (AOP)
Use AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) to log method execution times and trace API calls in the microservices.
Implement logging for authentication attempts and user activities.
Apply AOP to log critical operations in the employee service, such as CRUD operations, and log any errors/exceptions in a central log repository.
7. Microservices Communication (Inter-Service Communication)
Use REST for communication between the Authentication Service and Employee Service.
Feign Client can be used to make HTTP calls between microservices.
Optionally, you can implement message queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) to decouple services for async communication.
8. Service Discovery (Eureka)
Implement Eureka Server for service discovery, allowing the different microservices to register themselves and discover other services dynamically.
Microservices will use Eureka Clients to register with and discover the service registry.
9. API Gateway (Zuul or Spring Cloud Gateway)
Implement an API Gateway (using Zuul or Spring Cloud Gateway) to route requests to the correct microservice.
The gateway will handle all incoming requests and forward them to the appropriate microservice based on the path.
10. Database
Use MySQL or PostgreSQL for storing employee data, user information, and roles.
Implement Spring Data JPA for interacting with the database.

Technologies to Use:

-Spring Boot for all services.

-Spring Security for securing REST APIs.

-JWT for authentication.

-Spring AOP for aspect-oriented programming (logging and profiling).

-Spring Cloud for microservices architecture (Eureka, API Gateway).

-Spring Data JPA for database integration.

-Spring Boot Actuator for health checks and performance monitoring.

-Feign Client for inter-service communication.
